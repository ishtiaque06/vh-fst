Installation
============

To use the command-line tool :code:`app.py`, you need to have Python 3 installed
on your machine. Currently it's been tested on Python 3.7, but any Python 3 version
should work.

To generate graphs for all the vowel-harmony patterns using the :code:`utils.py` tool,
however, you need to have `GraphViz <https://www.graphviz.org/download/>`_ installed.
